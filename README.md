# Java Katas

Some of katas collected from the Internet have no step-by-step processes,
so I extarct the processes from articles and implemented them in Java.

## What is kata

Kata is practice code, that is repeatedly written to hone the proficiency of various programming skills
(such as using IDE shortcut keys, using design patterns to refactor code, etc.),
to achieve the state of subconsciously completing hand actions.

## Usage

1. Select one kata which you are interested in.
2. Read source article to understand the resolution process.
3. Read codes in /src/java/... to understand writing steps.
4. Build a new Java project in you IDE, begin practising.
5. Pay attention to using methods to reduce the time to complete it,
such as IDE shortcut keys, and try to make the operation steps form muscle memory.
